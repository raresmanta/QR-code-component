## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

Not much learned, but it was a good recap. I learned that by typing html and then pressing tab results in my code app automatically filling in a template with html code, which is pretty cool.
I remembered the different ways to separate code, classes, ids, css stuff etc.
on and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
